Hello! I’m Gabriela and I'm a software engineer with a passion for continuous improvement and writing clean, modular code in a collaborative setting. I’m fascinated with finding the intersection of technology and art, and I thrive in an environment that marries my love of creativity and solving tough problems.

In the past I’ve worked on applications that leveraged TypeScript, React, SQL/NoSQL databases, AWS and Docker-- and my goal is to continue building web apps that have a high focus on code readability and reusability, while simultaneously delivering a seamless user experience.

In my free time you can find me self-teaching Japanese or French, scouring the internet to find new editions to add to my personal library, or building (yet another) mechanical keyboard.
