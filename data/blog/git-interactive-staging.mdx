# Interactive Git Staging

One of the things I've been focused on recently is learning to incorporate some of Git's more advanced capabilities into my workflow when making changes to a codebase from the command line-- whether it be on a team project or a private repo that only I am contributing to. One of my favorite things to do when learning a new technology or skill is to do everything in my power to master it completely and while I'm leagues away from "mastering" version control, now seemed like as good a time as any to give leveling up a shot.

I started a couple weeks back by tackling my fear of `git rebase` (not so scary after some research and a great explanation of how rebasing works from Nina Zakharenko's Frontend Masters course **_["Git In-depth"](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/git-in-depth/)_**), but today I want to talk a little bit about interactive staging using `git add -p`, or `git add --patch`. Nina also covers this briefly in her Git course, which I can't recommend highly enough.

It should be noted that you can also enter interactive staging mode with `git add -i`, but passing the `--patch` flag instead allows you to bypass the command screen you'll encounter when using the `-i` flag.

## So What Is It For, Exactly?

Per the Git Documentation, the `-p`, or more verbose `--patch` flag allows you to:

_Interactively choose hunks of patch between the index and the work tree and add them to the index. This gives the user a chance to review the difference before adding modified contents to the index._

_This effectively runs add --interactive, but bypasses the initial command menu and directly jumps to the patch subcommand. See “Interactive mode” for details._

## Some Additional Reading

- [Interactive Staging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Interactive-Staging)
- [Git Add](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add)

This can be particularly helpful if you've made multiple changes across files and want to stage portions, or "hunks" of them to be commited while selectively ignoring others.
